<h1><br/>Subjects</h1>

<p>Add study subjects to track your progress in them. For adding
     subject, select the menu item <b>Add subject</b> and enter the name of the subject (for
     popular subjects hints appear). To add marks for a subject, tap
     subject cards to go to the subject page.</p>


<h3><br/>Subject card</h3>

<p>The subject card displays the name of the subject, the number of marks entered (the number in a circle
     next to the name, as well as an indicator in the form of a stripe of rectangles, the colors of which
     correspond to the entered subjects) and an indicator that can display different
     info:</p>

<ul>
     <li>average mark</li>
     <li>forecast estimate</li>
     <li>target mark</li>
     <li>final mark</li>
</ul>

<div class="marked">To quickly change the displayed information, simply tap the indicator.
</div>

<p>See the tooltip on the subject page for more details on the different marks.</p>


<h3><br/>Deleting subjects</h3>

<p>To delete a subject, swipe left on its card and click on the
     <b>Delete</b> button.</p>


<h3><br/>Subjects totals card</h3>

<p>The subject tottals card (if enabled in the settings) is always displayed at the top of the list
     and shows:</p>
<ul>
     <li>total number of subjects</li>
     <li>total number of marks across all subjects if average is selected in the indicator, or
         number of marks corresponding to the current indicator mode
     </li>
     <li>minimum and maximum marks for the selected indicator mode</li>
     <li>average value across all subjects for the selected indicator mode</li>
</ul>


<h3><br/>Ordering subjects</h3>

<p>By default, subjects are displayed in alphabetical order. You can choose the ordering of subjects
     by the value of the current indicator — to do this, tap the menu item <b>Value</b>. Current
     ordering mode is displayed with a cherkmark next to the name of the menu item. You can also 
     touch the marked menu item once again to reverse the sorting order. Current sorting order
     is displayed with an icon in the form of a corner pointing up or down.</p>


<h2><br/>Archive</h2>

<p>You can move (or just copy) the current grades to the archive — for example, at the end of the quarter
     or semester/trimester.</p>

<p><b>Important!</b> In the archive, you can perform all the same actions as with the current marks:
     add and remove marks and subjects, add final marks, and change goals. Addition and
     deleting subjects in current marks page does not affect the archive in any way (and vice versa).</p>
