<h1><br/>Calculator</h1>

<p>Use the number buttons to enter ratings. Use the dash key to enter
     a sign of lack of evaluation.</p>

<p>Tap the rating you entered to highlight it. Click the number button to change
     highlighted rating, or the left arrow button to delete it.</p>

<div class="marked">If no rating is selected, the left arrow button removes the last one
     rating on the list.
</div>

<p>When one of the ratings is highlighted, use the buttons above the number bar to add or
     change the comment on the rating, and add or change the rating date. Grades with date
     are ordered in ascending order by date, with ratings without a date at the end of the list. Date of assessment
     appears below the rating. If a comment is specified for a rating, in the upper right corner of the rating
     a dot is displayed. When a rating with a comment is selected, the comment text appears above
     number pad. You can also tap and hold any rating with a comment,
     to see the comment text in a pop-up panel without selecting a rating. This can also be done
     in a card with all grades on the subject page.</p>

<p>The <b>C</b> button (available only on the initial screen of the application) completely clears the list of ratings.</p>

<p>If weighted average scores are enabled in the app settings, you can change the score weight by
     by moving the slider above the keyboard (the selected weight value is displayed to the right of it).</p>
