<h1><br/>Archive</h1>

<p>Use an archive to save all current marks (for example, after completing a study
     quarter or semester/trimester).</p>

<div class="marked">After creating an archive, you can perform all the same actions in it as with
     current marks:
     <ul>
         <li>add and modify current and final marks in subjects</li>
         <li>add and remove subjects</li>
     </ul>while the changes will not affect the current marks (on the <b>Subjects</b> page) and others
     archive folders.
</div>

<p>To create an archive, select the menu item <b>Create archive</b> and specify a name for it (field
     with name cannot be empty). You can also choose whether to clear current marks (which are currently
     on <b>Subjects</b> page) after creating the archive.</p>

<p>To delete an archive, drag its card to the left and click the <b>Delete</b> button.</p>

<p>Archived cards are displayed in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>After creating an archive, you can change its name. To do this, enter the archive folder and in the menu
     select <b>Rename</b>.</p>

<p>The archive card displays the same information as the summary card on the item page.</p>

<div class="marked">The indicator on the archive card is selected regardless of the current indicator on
     item cards on the <b>Subjects</b> page. To change it just touch him.
